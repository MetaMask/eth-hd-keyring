## [Unreleased]

## [5.0.1]
### Uncategorized
- remove prepack script and references ([#77](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/77))

## [5.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Update minimum Node.js version from v12 to v14 ([#67](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/67))
- **BREAKING:** Makes version-specific `signTypedData` methods private ([#71](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/71))
    - Consumers should use the generic `signTypedData` method and pass the version they'd like as a property in the options argument.
- **BREAKING:** Makes the `wallets` property private ([#71](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/71))
    - Consumers should not use this property as it is intended for internal use only.
- **BREAKING:** Makes `getPrivateKeyFor` a private method ([#71](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/71))
    - Consumers who wish to get the private key for a given account should use the `exportAccount` method.
- **BREAKING:** Bumps browser requirements to those with ES2020 support or greater ([#70](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/70))
    - This change is introduced in update of `@metamask/eth-sig-util` to v5 and new direct dependency on `ethereumjs/util` v8.0.2
- Replaces use of `ethereumjs-wallet` implementation of hdkey with one from `ethereum-cryptography` and adapts accordingly.  ([#69](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/69))
- Replaces `@metamask/bip39` with `@metamask/scure-bip39` ([#67](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/67))

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove redundant `newGethSignMessage` method ([#71](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/71))
   - Consumers can use `signPersonalMessage` method as a replacement for newGethSignMessage.
- **BREAKING:** `HDKeyring` no longer extends `EventEmitter`, so no `EventEmitter` methods are available on this class ([#70](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/70))
- Removes `ethereumjs-util` dependency. ([#67](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/67))

## [4.0.2]
### Added
- Add parameter validation for constructor / `deserialize` method ([#65](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/65))
    - As of v4.0.0, the `deserialize` method (which is also called by the constructor) can no longer generate accounts with the `numberOfAccounts` option without a `mnemonic`. Prior to v4.0.0, a mnemonic was generated automatically if it was missing, but we now want to ensure a mnemonic is never implicitly generated without the caller knowing.

## [4.0.1]
### Added
- Add tests to get coverage to 100% ([#62](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/62))

### Fixed
- Fix bug where an unexpected error would occur if the mnemonic passed to `_initFromMnemonic` was a buffer array ([#62](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/62))

## [4.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Do not allow re-initialization of keyring instance ([#55](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/55))
    - Consumers are now required to call generateRandomMnemonic() after initialization for creating new SRPs.
- **BREAKING**: Update minimum Node.js version from v10 to v12 ([#45](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/45))
- Add `@lavamoat/allow-scripts` ([#47](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/47))
    - We now have an allowlist for all post-install scripts. The standard setup script has been added, along with new contributor documentation in the README to explain this script.
- Obfuscate serialized mnemonic ([#59](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring/pull/59))
    - Class variable `mnemonic` on `HdKeyring` can now be either type `Buffer` or type `string`.
    - Deserialize method (and `HdKeyring` constructor by extension) can no longer be passed an options object containing a value for `numberOfAccounts` if it is not also containing a value for `mnemonic`.
- Package name changed from `eth-hd-keyring` to `@metamask/eth-hd-keyring`.
